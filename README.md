HTML Synthesis through Layout

# Setup
- I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to server files from the project root directory. Once installed, you can run `http-server` from the project root and the app will be available in your browser at localhost:8080
- Files are bundled using [browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify). After installing it, you can run `browserify main.js -o bundle.js` from the project root
